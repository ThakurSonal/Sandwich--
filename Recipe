Trim the edges of the bread slices
Spread a generous amount of butter on each bread slice
Now spread the green chutney evenly on each slice as well. Use as much or as little as you need
Now place the boiled potatoes on 3 slices in one even layer
Sprinkle some cumin powder and black salt over this
Next, layer cucumber, onions, and tomato slices
Sprinkle more cumin powder and black salt
Place another slice of bread over this that has been buttered and spread with chutney as well
Press down gently so that the ingredients stick together and donâ€™t fall out easily
Repeat until you have 3 large sandwiches
Use a sharp knife to further quarter each into 4 smaller pieces
Plate them and serve immediately with more green chutney, if needed
